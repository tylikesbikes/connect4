The main functional issue I'm aware of and I'd like to fix has to do with the 'ghost' pieces hovering at the top of the game table.  After you click to place a piece, the color of the ghost piece showing won't update until you move your mouse into a different top row cell.

Another thing I'd like to do is highlight the four squares that create the win condition once the game ends.
